# Philosophy
React Routing is called "Dynamic Routing" - Quit different than "Static Routing"

## Static Routing
Rails, Express, Ember, Angular all use static routing
  * Routes are declared as part of your app's initialization before any rendering takes place

## Dynamic Routing
  * Routing that takes place as your app is rendering, not in a configuration or convention outside of a running app
    * This means that almost everything is a component in React Router
